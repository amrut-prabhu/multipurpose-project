# multipurpose-project

This is a project I developed as part of a team of 3 in early 2015. 

The project was developed using Dev C++ and WinBGIm library was used in order to incorporate graphics.

The project is made up of a couple of subprograms, namely:
  1. A time table generator for different classes, with a corresponding time table created for the teachers.
  2. A movie ticket booking system, which incorporates graphics in the "Choose your seat(s)" screen"
  3. The classic "Rock, Paper, Scissors" game, implemented with 3 difficulty levels.
  4. A banking system
 
 In retrospect, this project seems to be all over the place, and lacks direction :P  
 At the time, we were just trying to do as much as we could and just combined these disconnected subprograms into one.
 However, I am still quite happy with the implementations in the code, given our expercience at the time.
